Working in a team of 2, Aishath and i created an app for the user to choose a cocktail they would like to make themselves. By clicking on the tick you will see the instructions and ingredients.

##  The API
We used TheCocktailDB API to generate a wide range of cocktails. This API allowed us to access the cocktails from multiple ways which was how we could display the ingredients separately.


## :confounded: Challenges
We had trouble figuring out how to link the measurements of the the liquor to the ingredient as they were listed separately. Needed to implement the `startsWith()` method in order to select the correct key value.

## :trophy: Wins
Had a great time working with Aishath. Felt like a great achievement to finish an app in a hackathon style of 48hours and also incorporating an API.
